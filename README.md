## Introduction:

Hai, Welcome to my Git Assignment Project for ICHEC (Irish Centre for High-End Computing) for the academic year 2024-2025. 
Sciprog_24 repository acts as the central location for my weekly practical, where I have explained my understanding and the concepts of weekly lessons of scientific programming, and all the code has been done using C language.

I have created a separate branch for each weekly practicals and placed on a separate folder to maintain a clean and structured workflow. This setup allows for easy code management, version control, and cross-verification of expected outputs.

## Project Structure:

Please find breakdown of the branch structure:

### Main Branch: It contains the README.md file and general documentation.

Practical Branches: Each practicals has its own branch, labeled as practical<number>. 
These branches contain the source code files for each specific practicals, coded in C language.
A README.md file detailing how to compile, run, and verify the code.

For example:

practical-3

README.md (Descriptions and Instructions of questions for practical 2)
main.c (Code for practicals 2)

### How to Run Each Practical:

Each README.md file within the practical branches provides detailed instructions on how to:

Compile the code using gcc (GNU Compiler Collection).
Run the executable.
Verify the output against the expected results.
